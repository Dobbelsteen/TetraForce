"""
Unlocked camera zone
Keeps track of players and enemies, it's used to figure out which enemies are in the unlocked region
and to attach a personal camera to the player, as well as disconnect it when needed.
Make sure to NOT include the outer ring of tiles you want to display
- see unlock_camera and lock_camera for more details
It's pretty much impossible to resize the detection area, would be a nice enhancement
